\chapter{Conclusion}

In conclusion, the presentation and the course in general have given me a different perspective on the way presentations can be constructed and designed. I have already given so many presentations without directly thinking about the effects of the individual techniques. My main take away is that I can not only convey the information, but I now know to keep the audience tense and awake, how I have to build my structure through the presentation in a meaningful way (e.g. BOMBER B) and how I can easily reflect the difficult-to-unterstand technical aspects through targeted word choice (e.g. VAKOG). Another insight I gained from my presentation is the use of rhetorical questions. One example for this was the question \enquote{Okay fine, but what actually is bootstrap sampling?}, and with this approach, I could simply illustrate to the audience what exactly is meant by the technical expression. My biggest challenge was the information, which was very theoretical and difficult to unterstand and then how to explain and present it in a simplified and clear way. Presentations that contain a lot of theory are usually boring, that's the reason why I used a \enquote{Bang} to involve the audience. The other point for mastering this challenge is the use of the \enquote{VAKOG}-System to transform the information in a more illustrative and comprehensible way. Another important point is the use of Sign-Posting. Before the course and the presentation, I always created a presentation with different parts and sections without being aware that there is such a technique like Sign-Posting and what it's used for. Signposting creates \enquote{verbal paragraphs} or \enquote{verbal singals} to raise the attention curve at the beginning and eand of each point of your presentation. Therefore it is technique to help you to structure and sahpe the main content of your presentation \autocite[]{williams2008presentations}. All in all, I can now not only give an informative presentation, but I am also aware of what I am doing or acting on and I now know the resulting effect of it.
